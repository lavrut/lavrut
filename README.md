# Hi there, I'm LaVon! ðŸ‘‹

## Ongoing Project: Multi-Agent Drone Avionics :rocket: :airplane:
I'm currently developing a multi-agent, LLM-driven avionics system for autonomous drones. 

This project focuses on:
- **Hierarchical Control:** Parent orchestrator delegating to specialized agents.
- **Domain-Specific Tools:** Navigation, Flight Control, Recon, Weapons, and Communications.
- **Safety & Robustness:** Integrating traditional controllers for safety-critical tasks.
